Ammendment is a Xcode Source Extension containing a set of features that I personally use.

# Features

## Selection

### Select Line 

Select lines where cursors at.

### Select Next

Defaultly, it will select the word next to cusor. Calling this command again will select the next occurrence of previous selected text (works with multiline selections too).

If multiple selections exist, but not all of the selected texts are the same, calling the command again will do nothing.

If multiple cursors are added, it will select all words next to cursor.

## Cursor

### Move Cursors 5 Lines Up/Down

### Add Cursor Above/Below

## Modification

### Join Lines

### Increase / Decrease
