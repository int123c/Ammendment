Ammendment is an Xcode Source Extension containing a set of features that I personally use.

# Features

## Selection

### Select Line 

Select lines where cursors at.

### Select Next

A combination of "select word next to cursor" and "select next occurrence".

(I didn't know Find > Select Next Occurrence exists...But at least this version works more like that of vscode since it also does the first-step selection) 

## Cursor

### Move Cursors 5 Lines Up/Down

Moves all curosrs up / down 5 lines, keeping columns unchanged if possible. 

### Add Cursor Above/Below

Add a cusor above the top most cursor or below the one at bottom, keeping column unchanged if possible. 

## Modification

### Join Lines

Join lines into a single line within one selection, separating by whitesapces.

### Increase / Decrease

Increase / Decrease selected numerics by 1 (for integer) or 0.1 (for floating point).
